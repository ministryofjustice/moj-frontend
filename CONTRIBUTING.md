- What happened

## Suggesting features

Please [raise feature requests as issues](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-frontend/issues) before contributing any code.

Raising an issue ensures they are openly discussed and before spending any time on them.

## Contributing code

### Versioning

Follow the guidelines on [Semantic Versioning](semver.org) for assigning version numbers.

Change versions in a commit of their own, in a pull request of their own. This commit alerts team members to the new version and allows for last-minute scrutiny before the new version is released. Also, by raising a separate pull request, we avoid version number conflicts between feature branches.

### Commit hygiene

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move thing to..." not "Moves thing to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Use a [pull request template](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/mojdt-frontend/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)
