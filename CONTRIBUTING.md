### Versioning

Versioning is now handled automatically based on your commit messages by using [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) and [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen).

With these 2 packages and a few helper ones, we are able to construct reliable versioning based off of descriptive commit messages.

To aid with the formatting of messages we use commitizen to guide us through our commits.

Below are instructions on how the git workflow goes now

- Ensure you have run `npm install`
- When you are ready to commit, run `git add .` as usual
- Now from the command line run `git commit`
- You will have a range of prompts asking you what type of commit it is to descriptions on what the changes are
- Once you have filled these out a linter will check everything is okay and allow the commit to happen

From here you can push as you always have done.

When you come to do a Pull request, be sure to use a [pull request template](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE)

### Release

Due to the descriptive commits, we are now able to release automatically via CircleCI when a branch is merged into `main`. This takes roughly 5 minutes and then will appear on `npm` for people to consume.
