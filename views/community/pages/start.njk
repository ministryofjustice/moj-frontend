    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You can now use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others, by adding a community component. Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can do this.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It means that your component:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>will be easier to find for teams across government</li>
<li>can continue to develop, through contributions and help from other people</li>
<li>can be shared after a service assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What components can be added</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The component does not need to be thoroughly developed or accessibility tested, and it's OK to explain it briefly.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">It also does not need to be coded or designed in Figma - you can add just a screenshot.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you'll need:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the component name</li>
      <li>a description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll also be asked for some of your details. This is for the Design System team to contact you. Your name or team name will be added to the documentation, but only f you give your permission, y.</p>
