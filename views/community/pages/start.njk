<p class="govuk-body">You can add your work to the MoJ Design System by contributing a component.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">This means that:

<li>it'll be easier for other people in the community to find your designs and use in their service</li>
<li>other people can improve and add to it, which means the component will continue to develop</li>
<li>other people can improve and add to it, which means the component will continue to develop</li>



<p class="govuk-body">Anyone in a team at MoJ or in government can do this. The component does not need to be very developed or defined.
It can be used as a starting point, concept or idea.
 a It's OK to add a screenshot with a brief explanation of the component. You can also add something more developed, with code and a Figma design.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you need to add a brief description:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the name</li>
      <li>a description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your personal information</h4>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll also be asked for your:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>name</li>
      <li>email address</li>
      <li>team name</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps the Design System team if they need to contact you. Your details may also appear on the component documentation, but only if you give your permission.</li>
    </ul>
