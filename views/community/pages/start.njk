    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You can now use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others, by adding a community component. </p>

<p class="govuk-body">You might want to do this:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>to help teams tackling the same problems as you &mdash; the Design System makes your work easier to find and use</li>
<li>to develop your component &mdash; other people will be able to improve and add to what you've done</li>
<li>if you've had a service assessment and now need to share something you've designed and built</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Anyone can add a component to the MoJ Design System</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">This is open to everyone at MoJ and in UK government. You do not need to be a designer or a developer to contribute.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The component does not need to be thoroughly developed or accessibility tested, and you don't need to add lots of documentation. It's OK to add just a screenshot and a brief explanation, because it can be a starting point or idea for someone. If you have a Figma design and code, that's great too.</p>
</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you need to add:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the name</li>
      <li>a description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll also be asked for your name, email address and team name. This is for the Design System team to contact you, if they need to. Your name or team name will appear on the component documentation, but only if you give your permission.</p>
