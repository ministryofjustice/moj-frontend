    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You can now add a component to the MoJ Design System. You might want to do this to:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<li>make it easier for teams across government to find your work</li>
<li>get contributions from other people to help the component develop</li>
<li>help your team meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles">Government Design Principles</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page to the MoJ Design System.
</div>

<p class="govuk-body">You can add a component that has not been thoroughly developed or tested.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you'll need:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the component name</li>
      <li>a description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image of it</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll be asked for your details, so that you can be contacted when the component is live (or if there are queries). Your name or team name will only be added to the documentation if you give your permission.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">After you submit a component</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The MoJ Design System team will briefly check the component, and then it'll be live within 5 working days. Information may be added to the Github discussion.
