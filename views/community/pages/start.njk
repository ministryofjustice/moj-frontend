    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You can now use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others, by adding a community component. This is open to everyone at MoJ and in UK government. You do not need to be a designer or a developer to contribute.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Adding a component to doing this you can:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>make your work easier to find for teams across government working on the same problems</li>
<li>get input from other people to develop your component</li>
<li>share something you've designed and built, if you now need to after a service assessment</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What components can be added</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">The component does not need to be thoroughly developed or accessibility tested, and you do not need to add lots of documentation. It's OK to add just a screenshot and a brief explanation, as that can help someone starting from scratch with the same problem.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you have a Figma design and code you can add, that's also really helpful.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Anyone can add a component to the MoJ Design System</h2>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you need to add:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the name and description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>



    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll also be asked for your name, email address and team name. This is for the Design System team to contact you, if they need to. Your name or team name will appear on the component documentation, but only if you give your permission.</p>
