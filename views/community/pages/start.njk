    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Before you start</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You can now add a component to the MoJ Design System.</p>

Once component added to the Design System, it'll become a 'community component'. You might want to create this type of component to:

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people to help the component develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

^Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page to the MoJ Design System.^

<p class="govuk-body">You can add a component that has not been thoroughly developed or tested.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To submit a component to the Design System you'll need:

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the component name</li>
      <li>a description</li>
      <li>details about how it’s being used</li>
      <li>an image</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This helps people to understand what the component is and how to use it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll be asked for your details, so that you can be contacted when the component is live (or if there are queries). Your name or team name will only be added to the documentation if you give your permission.</p>

    ## What happens after you submit a component

    s1. The MoJ Design System team will briefly check it.
    s2. It'll go live, with an experimental status and a Github discussion thread. You'll get an email about this — usually within 5 working days.
    s3. Comments or information may be added to the Github discussion. You can subscribe to notifications for these. [View all MoJ Design System Github discussions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions)
