        <p class="govuk-body">The team will review the component. This can take up to 5 working days.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If there are no issues and the team does not need to contact you, the component will be added to the design system. It will include a "<strong>community</strong>" tag. This means it is still in the development phase.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will receive an email notification when the component is live in the MoJ Design System.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Collaborating with other users on the component</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Other users have the opportunity to add information about the component once it is live in the design system. If you've given permission, your details will be on the component page. This gives users the opportunity to start a conversation aimed at continuing development of the component.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This is part of the community approach the design system team is encouraging throughout the MoJ and wider government communities.</p>
