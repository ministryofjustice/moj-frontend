<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="a">A</h2>

### acronyms and initialisms
Acronyms and initialisms in services do not need to be spelt out if they are well understood by your audience. This also helps if it's difficult to spell them out, such as in a table.

If users are familiar with the acronym but you would still like to help them, you can spell it out afterwards, for example 'PDU (probation delivery unit)'.

For guidance or long-form content, spell them out on first mention (following the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#a">GOV.UK guidance on abbreviations and acronyms</a>).

### alerts (DPS only)
Only use 'alerts' when talking about alerts created in NOMIS or DPS.

Alerts can be 'active' or 'inactive'. You may find language in DPS that refers to 'adding', 'opening' and 'closing' alerts. We hope to make this language more consistent as we stop using NOMIS.

### aliases
Always 'aliases' when talking about other names a person has on their record. This term is commonly used and understood in prisons. Using a different term may confuse users.

### Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT)
Use ACCT. This is more well known than the full version.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="b">B</h2>

### breadcrumbs
Do not show the current page in the list of breadcrumbs.

In DPS, the first breadcrumb should always be 'Digital Prison Services'.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="c">C</h2>

### capitalisation
For general terms, follow the guidance in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide</a>.

We do not have a standard approach to capitalising acronyms or initialisms when they are written out in full.

You may decide to capitalise abbreviations when:

- you’re referring to the proper name for something
- it would help users understand what you’re referring to
- the full version of the abbreviation is long

Please share your decisions on capitalising abbreviations. We’ll add these as entries to the style guide to ensure consistency across DPS tools.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Category (such as Category A prison)
Always capitalise and write out in full. For example, 'Category A'.

Do not use 'Cat'.

Use 'Category A – high' for high-profile prisoners.

Use 'Category A – provisional' for provisional Category A prisoners.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### caseload (changing caseload)

If your service lets users change their 'caseload', always use 'change location' instead. 'Caseload' is a legacy term from NOMIS that would need explaining to users.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### case note

This is 2 separate words. Not casenote.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Cell Sharing Risk Assessment (CSRA)

Use CSRA. This is more well known than the full version.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Challenge, Support and Intervention Plan (CSIP)

Use CSIP. This is more well known than the full version.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### clock

See 'times' for guidance on using the 12 or 24-hour clock.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### closed prison, closed conditions

Lower case.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### contractions

Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide</a> and avoid using negative contractions like can’t and don’t.

Avoid contractions with a noun and verb such as ‘the computer’s fast’. This may be misunderstood as showing possession. Use ‘the computer is fast’ instead.

You can use positive contractions like we’ll and you’ll.

We’d like to test positive contractions with users to find out if they’re more difficult to understand.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### CRN (case reference number)

The reference assigned to a person on probation in nDelius. Not nDelius number, case number or CRN number. The initialism may be sufficient without being spelt out. The format is 2 characters, 4 numbers and then 2 characters for example ‘RG5108AC’.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="d">D</h2>

### dates
If users can choose a date range, use 'earliest' and 'latest' in your labels. For example:

'Date from (earliest)'

'Date to (latest)'

This is being used on the DPS prisoner profile alerts and case notes pages in response to user feedback.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="f">F</h2>

### forfeiture of privileges

Always use ‘loss of privileges’ when referring to the outcome of an adjudication hearing.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="g">G</h2>

### global search

Global search is a NOMIS screen used to search for people in any establishment or who have been released. This term has also been used in DPS and is commonly used by staff in prisons.

Only a limited number of staff have access to search for people across all establishments. This is controlled by a 'global search' role.

If you're referring to this type of search in your service, use the label 'In any establishment (global)'. This is being used on the DPS homepage and the non-associations service.

As we move away from NOMIS, we should be able to remove any reference to 'global'.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="h">H</h2>

### help content (DPS only)
When directing users to help and support, always use this content:

**Get help with DPS**
Call 0800 917 5148 or #6598 from inside an establishment.

This content does not provide any alternative contact methods such as email or chat. This may be raised as a recommendation if your service receives an accessibility audit.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### hint text

Always use full stops at the end of hint text, even when using examples.

We made this decision based on <a href="https://trello.com/c/cjE65vrR">research from other government departments and internal discussions</a>.

We’d like to test this approach to see if it causes users to include full stops in input fields.

This guidance only applies to hint text styled with the class “govuk-hint”.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Home Office reference number

Initial caps for 'Home Office'.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="i">I</h2>

### identity numbers
Use 'identity numbers' when referring to:

- PNC number
- Prison number
- CRO number
- Driving licence number
- Home Office reference number

Do not use 'identifiers' when referring to these items.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### incentive level, IEP

Always use ‘incentive level’.

References to ‘IEP’ were removed from DPS in response to the new Incentives Policy Framework. NOMIS has not been updated to reflect the policy change.

Staff in prisons may still use ‘IEP’ when referring to someone’s incentive level.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="k">K</h2>

### key worker
This is 2 separate words. Not keyworker.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="n">N</h2>

### naming
If you're naming a service in DPS, you should follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Va7AIp6cmlyNgs_x42A4KHw3wo5NFQebYO6EhO3lJxg/edit?usp=sharing">DPS naming guidelines</a>.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### NOMIS
Not Nomis or nomis. It's an initialism and stands for the National Offender Management Information System.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="non-associations">non-associations</h2>

A non-association is a record that says 2 prisoners must be kept apart.

Staff in some prisons may also refer to non-associations as:

- keep-aparts
- KSFs (keep separate from)
- non-associates
- non-association markers
- conflicts

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="o">O</h2>

### open prison, open conditions

Lower case.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="p">P</h2>

### Person Escort Record (PER)

Write out Person Escort Record (PER) at the first usage and use PER thereafter.

PERs are a document which must be completed for all people in custody prior to any escorted movement outside prison (for example to or from court or a transfer to another prison).

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### person on probation, people on probation

Do not use offender. Use person on probation and not the acronym PoP. Try to use people's names where possible.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### personal data in title tags

The page title is the text displayed in the browser tab. It is not the page heading or H1. Titles should describe the purpose and content of the page.

The title can be the same as the H1 unless the H1 includes personal information such as names. Do not include personal information in the title because it may be included in analytics data and cause data protection issues.

You can either write the title content or work with a developer to see if it can be taken from the H1 but without any personal information.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP)

Use PEEP. This is more well known than the full version.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Personal Identification Number (PIN)

Use PIN. This is more well known than the full version.

Prisoners use their secure PIN to call people on their approved contacts list from their in-cell PIN phones.

It is often written as pin or Pin, but PIN is the correct format.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### preferred name

Always use 'preferred name', not 'working name' as it's called in NOMIS.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### prison number

Always use ‘prison number’ when referring to the unique number given to someone when they arrive at prison. This term is widely used and understood by staff in prisons. It may need explaining in content or services for the public.

Do not use ‘prison no’, ‘prisoner number’, ‘NOMIS number’, ‘NOMS number’ or ‘offender number’.

Staff in prisons may still use ‘NOMIS number’ or ‘alpha number’ when referring to someone’s prison number.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### prisoner record

Always use ‘prisoner record’ when referring to the data stored about a person in prison. A prisoner record is linked to a prison number and can contain information from multiple bookings.

Do not use ‘prison record’, ‘NOMIS record’, ‘NOMS record’ or ‘offender record’.

We’d like to research this term further to make sure it’s the best way of describing the information we have about someone in prison.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### Probation Delivery Unit (PDU)

Use upper case and the initialism on first mention. Research is needed to establish if users will understand PDU without it being spelt out.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### probation practitioner

This is better than 'community offender manager (COM)', although someone may have this job title. Refers to a probation officer, probation support officer or senior probation officer.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="r">R</h2>

### reciprocal reason

Do not use.

This was a term used in NOMIS to name a field that was not brought over to DPS.

Instead, in DPS, each <a href="#non-associations">non-association</a> has a 'reason' and both prisoners have a 'role' in it.

Roles are usually victim or perpetrator.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### remand prisoner, on remand, remanded in custody

Someone is on remand if they are placed in custody whilst awaiting trial.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### ROTL (Release on Temporary Licence)

Use upper case.

Users may well understand the acronym on its own. If you have evidence of this, use the acronym first and then spell out in brackets.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="t">T</h2>

### times (in prison)

Use the 24-hour clock for DPS (Digital Prison Services) and any service used by prison staff. For example, 14:00 not 2.00pm.

The 24-hour clock should also be used for time input fields.

The 24-hour clock is widely used in prisons. Research has shown that <a href="https://trello.com/c/D57IWwVT">using the 12-hour clock in prison may cause confusion</a>.

If your service is on DPS but is used by both prison and probation staff, it should still use the 24-hour clock.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

### times (in probation)

Use the 12-hour clock for services in the probation space. For example, 11am.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="v">V</h2>

### Violent and Sex Offender Register (ViSOR)

Use ViSOR. This is more well known than the full version.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="w">W</h2>

### working name

See 'preferred name'.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="x">X</h2>

### X-ray body scan

Capital 'X' and lower case 'r'. Do not shorten to 'body scan' as this may be confused with other types of scans that take place in prisons.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="y">Y</h2>

### youth offender

This term is used to describe prisoners aged between 15 and 21. Although it goes against the principle of not referring to people in prison as 'offenders', this term is widely used across HMPPS. We have not agreed an alternative term to use.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">
