## Overview

The PDS header  allows users to access and navigate between services on the Probation Digital Services (PDS) platform. 
The header displays the name of the platform, and features account and global navigation menus.

### Account menu

The account menu allows users to view their account details, and sign in or out.

### Global navigation menu

The global navigation menu contains links to probation services. Users will only see links to services they have permission to access. 

### When to use

Use this header for internal probation services on the Probation Digital Services platform.

### When not to use

Do not use for services not on the Probation Digital Services platform.

Use the [MOJ header component](/components/header) instead.

{% tab "How to use" %}

## How to use

Do not add your service name to the header. It should only contain ‘Probation Digital Services’ to create a consistent experience for users.

You can add your service name as a heading, or as a caption to the existing heading. It should also be added to the breadcrumbs component, if used.

### Links

The MOJ crown logo and ‘Probation Digital Services’ text both link to Manage People on Probation, the Probation Digital Services homepage. 

### Using the header component in production

The [Probation Digital Services GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-frontend-component-api) contains a readme file with instructions on how to implement the component in your service.
