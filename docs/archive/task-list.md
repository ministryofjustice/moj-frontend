This page has been archived as a [task list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/task-list/) component has been included in the release of GOV.UK Frontend v5.0.0.
{% endbanner %}

A coded example of a task list is below, which is not yet in the GOV.UK Design System. There is also a [coded example of a task list page](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/templates/task-list) in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.
