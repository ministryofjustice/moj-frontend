{% banner "This component is archived" %}

This component was archived because the [GOV.UK Design System password input](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/password-input/) enables users to check their password safely. There’s also the [GOV.UK Design System ‘Ask users for passwords’ pattern](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/passwords/).

## When to use

Use the password reveal component to let users check their password safely.

This component automatically sets the `spellcheck` attribute to `false` to prevent users' passwords being stored in their browsers.
