## Asking multiple questions per page

Before asking multiple questions per page, you should first:

- follow the guidance to [start by asking one question per page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) in The GOV.UK Design System.
- follow the guidance to [start with one thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page) the GOV.UK Service Manual.

User research will tell you if it makes sense to group a number of related questions on the same page. For example, if you’re designing an internal service for government users who need to repeat and switch between tasks quickly.

If user research tells you to group pages together, you should:

- follow the guidance on [asking multiple questions on a page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#asking-multiple-questions-on-a-page) in the GOV.UK Design System.
