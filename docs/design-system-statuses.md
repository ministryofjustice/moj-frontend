## Overview

The building block statuses are:

- Experimental
- To be reviewed
- Official
- Archived

## ‘Experimental’ status <span class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--experimental" style="vertical-align:middle;" aria-hidden="true">Experimental</span>

The ‘experimental‘ status launched in September 2025. Building blocks that were submitted before then will be added to the Design System and given this status.

Experimental building blocks:

- are early in development
- may not have been accessibility tested or considered for use beyond a particular service
- can be anything from a screenshot with brief documentation, to something more developed (with code and a Figma design)

Anyone at MOJ can submit one. They're given a brief sense check by the Design System team before being published.

Find out [how to submit an experimental building block](/contribute/add-new-component/start). View an example: the [new features banner component](/components/new-features-banner).

### How to use ‘experimental’ building blocks

Do not use ‘experimental’ building blocks in a live service. This is unless they're already part of the service from earlier testing (like an alpha or beta phase) and:

- they worked well during testing
- any accessibility issues have been fixed (or there were not any)

Teams are encouraged to experiment with them and share findings in the [Github discussions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions/categories/experimental-components-pages-and-patterns).  

## ‘To be reviewed’ status <span class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--orange"  style="vertical-align:middle;" aria-hidden="true">To be reviewed</span>

Building blocks with a ‘to be reviewed’ status were added for use by everyone at MOJ, possibly a long time ago. They have not been reviewed recently and the work to develop them is not known.  

The Design System team is working to bring them all to ‘official’.  

### How to use ‘to be reviewed’ building blocks

You can use ‘to be reviewed’ building blocks in every product phase.

## ‘Official’ status <span class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--green"  style="vertical-align:middle;" aria-hidden="true">Official</span>

When an ‘experimental’ or ‘to be reviewed’ building block gets a full review by the Design System team it becomes ‘official’.

This review includes an organisation-wide discovery and multi-disciplinary team input (including accessibility testing). Usage is thoroughly documented.

### How to use ‘official’ building blocks

You can use ‘official’ building blocks in every product phase. They'll be supported and maintained in the long term.

## ‘Archived’ status <span class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--grey"  style="vertical-align:middle;" aria-hidden="true">Archived</span>

A building block is archived when it’s no longer needed. This is usually because the need has been met by the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) (which we do not want to duplicate).

### How to use ‘archived’ building blocks

Do not use ‘archived’ building blocks. They're no longer being supported.
