Every building block on the MoJ Design System has been given 1 of 4 statuses. This is to help you know how to use them. Each status’ building blocks have been developed in a different way. 

The Design System team is working to bring them all to the ‘established’ status. Building blocks will move between other statuses when they’re developed. They can also be archived.

Learn how you can [help develop design system building blocks](/get-involved/suggest-a-change/).

## 1. ‘Experimental’ status (for all community components)

Anyone can add a building block to the Design System. These are called community components and all start as ‘experimental’. They have no involvement from the MoJ DS team (apart from a brief sense check before being published). 

A community component can be anything from a screenshot to something more developed (with a Figma design and code). They’re a starting point, concept or idea. 

They’re early in development and may not have been considered (or accessibility tested) for use beyond a particular service. They’re not robust components and are only to be used in alpha and beta. 

The community section was created to enable people to share their design work and collaborate.   

## 2. ‘To be reviewed’ status  

These building blocks were added by the community for use by everyone at MoJ. They’re available in Figma and MoJ Frontend. 

The history for these components are not known, and they have not been reviewed recently. The work to review them is not known. They’ll be reviewed and then updated.  

## 3. ‘Official’ status (system building block)

Follows a review process 
Has had a full multi-disciplinary team review 
Fully accessible with any mentions of considerations
Reusable In Figma and code
Will be long-term supported and maintained 

You can [view the building blocks which have been developed in this way, and which are planned in the roadmap]. 

## 4. ‘Archived’ status

Is in archived section of documentation site.
Still exists in front end and Figma
