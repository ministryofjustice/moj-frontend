To help improve the MOJ Design System, you can suggest changes to components and patterns.

Useful suggestions may look like:

- new research or testing that can help improve an existing component or pattern
- reporting bugs where you've used a component or pattern in a live service and noticed an issue

## Tell us your suggestion

Tell us about the change you're proposing by using the [suggest a change form](https://forms.gle/FpDpbgttwmfmcz8o7). The MOJ Design System Group will be notified of your suggestion and will review it.

Once reviewed, the group will either:

- accept your suggestion and work to apply your change
- accept your suggestion but work with you to tweak the changes before going ahead
- not accept your suggestion and explain why
