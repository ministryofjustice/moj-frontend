To make your service consistent with GOV.UK, you should start by checking what exists in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

If something is not in the GOV.UK Design System, you should check what exists in the:

- MOJ Pattern Library
- [other departments pattern libraries](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list)
- [GOV.UK community backlog](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/)

Reuse as much as possible and iterate based on user needs.
## Using the Pattern Library

The MOJ Pattern Library brings together [components](./components) and [patterns](./patterns) created by designers and developers at MOJ.

To use these components and patterns you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)) 

## Contributing to the Pattern Library

You can contribute your research findings, designs or code to the MOJ Pattern Library by commenting on [existing discussions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions) or starting a [new discussion](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions/new) on GitHub.
