title: alerts (DPS only)
---

Only use ‘alerts’ when talking about alerts created in NOMIS or DPS (Digital Prison Services).

Alerts can be ‘active’ or ‘inactive’. You may find language in DPS that refers to ‘adding’, ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ alerts. This should become more consistent as users move away from using NOMIS.
