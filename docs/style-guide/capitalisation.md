For general terms, follow the guidance in the [style guide on
GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style).

There’s not a standard approach to capitalising acronyms or initialisms when they are written out in full.

You may decide to capitalise abbreviations when:

* you’re referring to the proper name for something
* it would help users to understand what you’re referring to
* the full version of the abbreviation is long

Please share your decisions on capitalising abbreviations in the [content community Slack channel (MoJ staff only)](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C58FBN6V6). These entries will be added to the content style guide to ensure consistency.
