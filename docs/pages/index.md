<span class="govuk-caption-xl">Use pages to create consistent user experiences across MoJ products and services.</span>

Pages are a combination of styles and components that are repeatable across user interfaces and services.

To use a page you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs))

<!-- include this bullet point when Figma UI Kit is completed

- use the MoJ Figma UI Kit

-->
