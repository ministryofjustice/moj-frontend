## Asking multiple questions per page

Before asking multiple questions per page, you should first:

- follow the guidance to [start by asking one question per page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) in The GOV.UK Design System.
- follow the guidance to [start with one thing per page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page) the GOV.UK Service Manual.


User research will tell you if it makes sense to group a number of related questions on the same page. For example, if youâ€™re designing an internal service for government users who need to repeat and switch between tasks quickly.

If user research tells you to group pages together, you should:

- follow the guidance on [asking multiple questions on a page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#asking-multiple-questions-on-a-page) in the GOV.UK Design System.
