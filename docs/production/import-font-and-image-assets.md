To use the font and image assets from MoJ Frontend and GOV.UK Frontend, you can either:

- serve the assets from the combined assets folders – recommended
- copy the font and image files into your application

## Serve the assets from the combined assets folders – recommended

Set up your routing so requests for files in `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/assets` are served from both `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets` and `/node_modules/@ministryofjustice/frontend/moj/assets`.

If you’re using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), request routing could be set up as follows:

```js
router.use('/assets', [
  express.static('node_modules/@ministryofjustice/frontend/moj/assets'),
  express.static('node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets')
])
```

## Copy the font and image files into your application

If you decide to copy the assets instead, copy the:

- `/node_modules/@ministryofjustice/frontend/moj/assets/images` contents to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`
- `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images` contents to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`
- `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts` contents to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`

You should use an automated task or your build pipeline to copy the files, so your project folder stays up to date when updates to MoJ Frontend and GOV.UK Frontend are released.
