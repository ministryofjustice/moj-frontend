      <td class="govuk-table__cell">‘Prison’ and ‘establishment’ are both acceptable terms. Which one you should use depends on the context and audience.

      ‘Prison’ refers only to adult prisons. It’s more likely to be understood by the public than ‘establishment’. Users with English as a second language may also find it easier to understand.

      Individual prison names can be used for clarity, for example ‘HMP Wayland’.

      ‘Establishment’ is used to collectively describe a mixture of prisons, young offender institutions (YOIs), dual-prison-YOIs, and Secure Training Centres (STCs). ‘Prison’ is inappropriate when describing settings accommodating children and young adults.

      ‘Establishment’ is widely used in NOMIS and DPS, with no reported issues.

      ‘Location’ may refer to places within the prison, for example, the gym.

      'Site' is sometimes used instead of prison or establishment, or to refer to where someone on probation is located. It might be used to describe places with several prisons or buildings..</td>
