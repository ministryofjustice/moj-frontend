<!-- ### How this was calculated

**£5,000** is the average cost of developing a reusable component.

**2,481** is the amount of times components are used in live MOJ services.

Multiplied, this tells us that an additional **£12.4M** would have been spent on making components on a per-service basis, if the Design System did not exist. -->

### User feedback

Users of the Design System were asked what they would like to see more of.

> For departments to collaborate when there's similar component and
share research

> Making visible the research and data that fed into the component and
what services are using it

> More components and patterns

## Achievements this quarter

### Product

<p>Anyone at MOJ can now add an 'experimental' component to the Design System, making it
quicker to deliver value. [Average value of an individual component]?​

1. £5,000 is the average cost for a team to create a component, as estimated by the DWP Design System team. This includes the necessary discovery, design, development, and QA/testing, as well as delivering the component to the required standard for use across a large organisation.​

2. From a code search, we can understand the total amount of times a component appears in code across MOJ services​, and details of a sample of results, including whether the service is live or a prototype. With this information, we can then determine what percentage of the sample are live services​, and apply this percentage to the total amount of times a component appears in code​ to estimate of the total amount of times a component appears in a live service​

<!-- **83%** of users asked use the MOJ Design System **daily**, or **a few times a week**

**50%** of users asked **strongly agreed** that the MOJ Design System saves them time and **improves the quality of their work**, and makes services more **consistent and accessible**. -->
