title: Accessibility statement for Ministry of Justice Design System
---

This accessibility statement applies to the Ministry of Justice Design System documentation website.

This website is run by Justice Digital, a Ministry of Justice service area. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

- The secondary navigation text is spilling off the screen when zooming in at 200%.
- There are headings on the main page and footer which are marked as heading level 2, but which use visually different font sizes.
- Some iframe headings are not marked up as headings.

## Feedback and contact information

If you need information on this website in a different format:

- [design-system@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:design-system@digital.justice.gov.uk)

We’ll consider your request and get back to you in 5 working days.

## Reporting accessibility problems with this website

We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: [design-system@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:design-system@digital.justice.gov.uk)

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the [Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

Ministry of Justice Digital and Technology is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- Content is lost or obscured when setting the browser width to 1280px and increasing magnification up to 400%. To view all options of the secondary navigation, the user would be required to scroll in multiple directions. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow)
- There are headings on the main page and footer which are marked as heading level 2, but which use visually different font sizes. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
- Some iframe headings are not marked up as headings. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)

We plan to address these issues by December 2022 apart from the unmarked iframe headings issue. This issue is a necessary effect of showing example snippets within pages and so cannot be fixed.

### Disproportionate burden

Does not apply

### Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

Does not apply

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We are aware of some accessibility issues and are making plans to fix these issues. We will monitor the accessibility of this website on an ongoing basis and plan to fix any accessibility issues reported to us.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on 16th August 2022. It was last reviewed on 16th August 2022.

This platform was last tested on 23rd June 2022. The test was carried out in-house by the Accessibility team.

In addition, The Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) carried out a full WCAG 2.1 AA level audit on all featured components and patterns contained by the Design System. It included extensive testing by users with a wide range of disabilities. This audit was performed on 30th April 2021. It highlighted a number of non-compliance issues, some of which have been addressed since.
