This accessibility statement applies to the MOJ Design System documentation website.

This website is run by Justice Digital. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
