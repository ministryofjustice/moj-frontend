<span class="govuk-caption-xl">The MoJ Design System helps teams to design, build and launch digital services that are accessible, consistent and user-led.</span>

## Overview

The Design System is an ecosystem of pages, patterns and components, called building blocks. These are reusable, repeatable parts of a service. The building blocks have 3 parts:

- documentation on the MoJ Design System site
- a Figma file showing the design
- code in MoJ Frontend

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  Read about how ‘experimental’ (community components) are different.
</div>

The Design System also hosts common approaches, such as the content style guide, and guidance on designing ethical services. 

## Updates to services and prototypes

The building blocks are centrally managed and updated. This means that you can apply updates in one go, and not have to find instances of the building block and change them manually.

### How building blocks are updated

1. A building block is developed by the DS team and a new version is created in Figma and MoJ frontend. This can be a change to an existing version or a new block. 

2. The new version is communicated to MoJ teams.

3. When MoJ staff go into Figma or MoJ frontend, they are prompted to apply an update.

4. Existing versions of building blocks in Figma, coded prototypes and live services update to these new versions.  

- Detached components (should this actually be building blocks)
- Link with GOV.UK Figma kit
- Where, how and why do we link out to figma and coded prototypes guidance?

## Consistency and efficiency 

When MoJ services are consistent with one another it makes them easier to use. 

Using building blocks from the MoJ Design System reduces the amount of time teams spend solving problems. This is because teams can benefit from the problem-solving work of others. 

The content style guide ensures that phrases and terms are the same across different services.

All this work gives teams more time to focus on unique or complex problems.

## Standards

The MoJ Design System building blocks enable teams to deliver services which meet the standard of accessible, ethical and user-centred. 

DS building blocks provide a clear visual style, interaction standards and code semantics. 

Ethical principles help teams to produce quality products for people in the justice system. 

All ‘established’ building blocks have been developed by a multidisciplinary team. They will have the input of a content designer, interaction designer, front-end developer, accessibility specialist, design system lead and delivery manager.
