Unifying page widths across probation services creates a consistent experience for users.

For all other layout recommendations, follow the [GOV.UK Design System layout guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/).

## Page width

The recommended page width is 1280px. This includes a 55px margin on both sides, with a content area of 1170px. You can make it wider if your content requires it. 

### Limiting width of content

The [GOV.UK Design System layout guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/) recommends that text should be no more than 75 characters per line, otherwise the content becomes difficult to read. For services with a page width of 1020px, this is done by using a ‘two-thirds’ width column.

​For pages wider than 1020px, a ‘two-thirds’ column will be too wide, so the content should be constrained to ensure no more than 75 characters per line are displayed.
