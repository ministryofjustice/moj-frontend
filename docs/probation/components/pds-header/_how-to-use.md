## How to use

Do not add your service name to the header. It should only contain ‘Probation Digital Services’ to create a consistent experience for users.

You can add your service name as a heading, or as a caption to the existing heading. It should also be added to the breadcrumbs component, if used.

### Links

The MOJ crown logo and ‘Probation Digital Services’ text link to either:

* Manage people on probation (MPoP), for users with access to it
* your service's homepage, for users with no access to MPoP

MPoP is the Probation Digital Services homepage.

### Using the header component in production

The [Probation Digital Services GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-frontend-component-api) contains a readme file with instructions on how to implement the component in your service.
