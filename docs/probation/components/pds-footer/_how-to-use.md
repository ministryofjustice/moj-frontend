## How to use

### If you have an accessibility statement published 

Before implementing the footer, email a copy of your accessibility statement to [design-system@justice.gov.uk](mailto:design-system@justice.gov.uk).

It will be reviewed, converted to Markdown and uploaded to the Probation Digital Services GitHub repository.

#### To update your accessibility statement

You can submit a pull request with the updated content to the [Probation Digital Services GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-frontend-component-api), or email your content changes to <design-system@justice.gov.uk>.

The Design System team will send out an annual reminder to do an accessibility review and update your accessibility statement if necessary. 

### Using the footer component in production

The [Probation Digital Services GitHub repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-frontend-component-api) contains a readme file with instructions on how to implement the component in your service.
