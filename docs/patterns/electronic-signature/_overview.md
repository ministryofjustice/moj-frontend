## Overview
The electronic signature pattern allows users to legally sign a document or instrument online. 

Policy experts in the Lasting Power of Attorney team have assured that this method of signing online is legally compliant.  

There’s a challenge in helping people used to wet signatures to understand that ticking a box is as secure and meaningful as making a unique mark with a pen. 

This pattern has tested very well. A lawyer (a professional user) gave high praise to how the pattern checks that a user understands it and is able to sign online in this way.  

It’s also been successful with the public, who often prefer and trust more traditional methods for legal processes.  

The team found that having guidance on signing electronically in specific parts of the journey before signing was key to giving people the confidence to break with tradition. 

### How the pattern is currently used

The key user need for this for the ‘Make and register an LPA’ service is to reduce the need for certain groups of people to all be in the same room at the same time. Because this is difficult to coordinate, multiple signatures end up being added to the instrument at different times. 

It’s also faster than processing paper forms.
