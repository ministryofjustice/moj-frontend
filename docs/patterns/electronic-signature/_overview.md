## Overview
The electronic signature pattern allows users to legally sign a document or instrument electronically online.

We are lucky to have policy experts embedded in our team and so we have assurance that this method of signing online is legally compliant. Our challenge is to help users, used to wet-signatures, understand that ticking a box is secure and meaningful as making a unique mark with a pen.

So far this has tested very well. In one case a lawyer (a professional user)and self confessed code-writer gave high praise to the diagnostic of assessing a users understanding of, and ability to sign online in this way. It has been surprisingly successful also with our average lay person demographic who often prefer and trust the more traditional methods for such legal processes. We have found that the guidance supporting the tickbox across multiple pages is the key in user confidence in breaking with tradition.

### How the pattern is currently used

The key user need for this in the case of the ‘Make and register an LPA’ service is to reduce the need for certain groups of people having to all be physically in the same room at the same time, which can be difficult for our typical demographic to organise and coordinate and it introduces asynchronicity into multiple signatures being added to the instrument.

Higher level, for any Gov service, reducing the reliance on wet signatures could contribute to the reduction of the use of paper forms which would be a big win that needs no explanation.

### Contribute to this pattern
You can help develop this pattern by adding information to the [‘electronic signature’ Github discussion]({{ githuburl }}). This helps other people to use it in their service.
