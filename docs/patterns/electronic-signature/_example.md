## Example

### Step 1: Check that the user can sign their LPA themselves

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-1.png" alt="A screenshot of the "Make and register a lasting power of attorney (LPA)" service. The page title is "Your details" and has  fields for name and date of birth. It asks whether the user can sign the LPA themselves online, with three radio button options: Yes, No, and I don’t know. "I don't know" is selected. Next is a "Continue" button." />
</div>

### Step 2: Help users when they're not sure if they can sign

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-2.png" alt="A screenshot titled “Check that you can sign your LPA.” The page explains that you must sign your LPA before it can be registered and that this can be done online. It includes sections on how to sign your LPA online, guidance for using assistive technology, and instructions if you cannot tick the box yourself. There is an example tick box shown and a question asking, “Will you be able to sign the LPA yourself?” with Yes and No radio buttons. There's a “Continue” button./>
</div>

### Step 3: Sign the LPA 

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-3.png" alt="A screenshot titled “Sign your LPA.” The page explains that signing your LPA is an important legal step and includes a section on what happens once signed. It lists confirmations such as reading the LPA, granting authority to make decisions, and choosing people to act. There is a section labeled “Your signature” with two checkboxes: “I want to sign this LPA as a deed” and “I want to apply to register this LPA.” Neither of the checkboxes are selected. Below, instructions state that ticking the boxes and selecting “Submit my signature” legally signs the LPA. There's a green primary button labelled “Submit my signature” and a grey secondary button labeled “Return to task list” at the bottom. The page includes a reveal explaining how ticking boxes acts as a legal signature." />
</div>

### Step 4: An error message for when the user has not selected both options 

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-4.png" alt="A screenshot shows a GOV.UK error message summary for the signature section. This is on the “Sign your LPA” page. The error message is "Select both boxes to sign and apply to register your LPA." />
</div>

### Step 5: Send the LPA witness a code 

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-5.png" alt="A screenshot titled “Witnessing your signature.” The page explains that the certificate provider must confirm they witnessed the signing of the LPA. Instructions state that after selecting “Continue,” a text message with a unique code will be sent to the certificate provider, who must enter it on the next screen. A warning indicates the code is valid for 30 minutes. At the bottom, there are two buttons: a green “Continue” button and a grey “Return to task list” button." />
</div>

### Step 6: The LPA witness enters their code

<div class="img-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/submission-1765201728043/electronic-signature-6.png" alt="A screenshot titled “Confirm you witnessed the donor sign their LPA.” The page states that a code has been sent by text message to the phone number. It instructs the certificate provider to enter the 4-digit code to confirm witnessing the signing. There is an input box for the code, a green “Continue” button, and a grey “Return to task list” button. A reveal below reads “I’m having a problem with the code.”/>
