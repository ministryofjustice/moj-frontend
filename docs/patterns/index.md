Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and needs. They include examples of successful approaches but are flexible and don't prescribe exact design solutions.

To use a pattern you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs))

<!-- include this bullet point when Figma UI Kit is completed

- use the MoJ Figma UI Kit
