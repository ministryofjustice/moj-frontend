HDC (home detention curfew) allows prisoners to serve part of their sentence at home, under electronic monitoring.

Use HDC. This is more well known than the full version. If you have evidence that HDC is not well understand by your audience, use home detention curfew.

If you're combining HDC with other terms to make a longer initialism like HDCED, consider spelling out the additional words, for example HDC eligibility date. This makes it easier to read alongside other acronyms.
