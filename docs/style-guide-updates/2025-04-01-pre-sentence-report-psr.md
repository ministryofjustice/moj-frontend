Write out pre-sentence report (PSR) on first mention and use PSR or 'the report' thereafter.

PSRs are reports that a court uses to help decide on a defendant's sentence. They consider a defendant's offending behaviour, the risk they pose and to whom. A PSR will provide an independent recommendation of the sentencing options available to the court.
