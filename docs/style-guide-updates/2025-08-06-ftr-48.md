FTR48 is the policy that states people with sentences of up to 48 months will get a 28-day recall, provided they meet certain eligibility criteria. The sentence length can be from one sentence or consecutive sentences. The policy is an interim measure and will be replaced with new legislation in 2026.

The initialism FTR, which stands for fixed term recall, is generally well understood in HMPPS and widely used in systems like NOMIS. Use FTR48 when referring to the specific policy.
