This refers to prison offender managers, who work with most people in prison during their time in custody.

There are 2 types:
- probation POMs – qualified probation practitioners employed by the Probation Service
- prison POMs – employed by HM Prison Service

While the term community probation practitioner has generally replaced COM, there's no similar alternative to POM. The abbreviation POM is commonly understood in prisons and the Probation Service.
