The term victim-survivor is the most common term used in the advocacy sector to describe someone who has experienced domestic abuse.

However, if you’re developing a product or service that victim-survivors use, it may be more appropriate to reference their experience instead of using this term.

For example, you could use the question ‘Have you experienced domestic abuse?’ rather than ‘Are you a victim-survivor of domestic abuse?’. See [guidance on using the term domestic abuse](/content-standards/style-guide#domestic-abuse).
