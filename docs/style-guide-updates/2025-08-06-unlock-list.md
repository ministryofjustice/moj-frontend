A list of people in an area of a prison who are due to go to an activity or an appointment.

It contains people’s names, prison numbers, what they are due to go to, and when they have to be there.

For each unlock, wing officers use the list to let the right people out of their cells and off the wing.

It is not used in Category D prisons.

Sometimes known as an ‘unlock roll’, ‘leaving list’, or ‘free flow list’.
