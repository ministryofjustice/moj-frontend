There is little consensus in the department about how to style some acronyms and initialisms, especially if one letter refers to a preposition.

However, you should consider writing acronyms and initialisms entirely in upper case. For example, ROSH instead of RoSH and MOJ instead of MoJ. This is because:

* studies, such as in the [Memory and Cognition journal article on reader ability](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03198246) suggest that abbreviations written in a mix of upper and lower case are harder to read, especially for less skilled readers
* it follows the convention established by the abbreviation of [ROTL for Release on Temporary Licence](/content-standards/style-guide#rotl-%28release-on-temporary-licence%29) and so helps to improve consistency
* guidance from the Guardian and GOV.UK recommends writing similar abbreviations such as MOT and FOI entirely in upper case

You should use a mix of upper and lower-case letters when referring to the names of systems such OASys and NDelius.
