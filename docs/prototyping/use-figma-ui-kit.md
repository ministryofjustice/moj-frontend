The [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040) supports designers in quickly creating consistent designs in Figma. This guide explains how to access and keep the Figma Kit up-to-date.

## If you work for MoJ Digital

Three Figma libraries are active by default for Figma users in MoJ Digital:
  - MoJ Figma Kit
  - GOV Figma Kit
  - GOV & MoJ Styles

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
    Do not use the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/946837271092540314">GOV.UK Design System Figma community file</a>.<br/>It does not receive updates and is not maintained by the MoJ Design System team.

### Check if the Figma Kits are active in your file

1. In a Figma design file, click 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel then click the book icon.

2. Under 'Libraries added to this file' you should see three libraries: GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit and MoJ Figma Kit. If you do, the Figma Kits are active and you don't need to do anything else.

### If the Figma Kit is not active in your file

1. Select 'Recommended' (with a light bulb icon) under 'Browse libraries' in the modal sidebar.

2. Hover over each library, and click the 'Add to file' button which appears.

3. Click 'This file' in the modal sidebar. You should now see these three libraries: GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit and MoJ Figma Kit. The Figma Kits are active and you don't need to do anything else.

### Apply updates from the Figma Kit

When updates to the Figma Kit are published, youâ€™ll be notified in Figma. To check for updates:

1. In a Figma design file, click 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel then click the book icon.
2. Select 'Updates' from the sidebar. Underneath the text saying who published the change and when, you'll see a short summary of the changes made. This is where information about any 'breaking' changes will be communicated.

3. Either click the 'Update all' button, or click 'Update' for each component you want to update.

## If you don't work for MoJ Digital

### Download and use the Figma Kit

1. Open the [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040) in Figma.
2. Click the Figma logo at the top of the left hand sidebar and go to File > Save local copy...
<p><img src="/assets/images/figma-guidance-download-kit.png" style="border:none" alt="x"></p>

3. Add the downloaded file into your project, publish it as a library, and use it in your files.

### Manually update the Figma Kit

1. Periodically check the live [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040) file for updates.
2. Save a local copy of the latest version of the Figma Kit.
3. Reload it into your Figma workspace as a library.
4. Open your design files, and use the [swap libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries) feature in Figma to replace all references to the outdated version of the MoJ Figma Kit. You will not be able to use 'swap libraries' if you don't have a paid Figma license, and will need to [swap components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413-Swap-components-and-instances) individually instead.
