The [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040) enables designers to create consistent designs in Figma. This guide explains how to access the Figma Kit and keep it up-to-date.

## If you work for MoJ Digital

3 Figma libraries are active by default for Figma users in MoJ Digital:
  - MoJ Figma Kit
  - GOV Figma Kit
  - GOV & MoJ Styles

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
    Do not use the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/946837271092540314">GOV.UK Design System Figma community file</a>.<br/>It's not updated or maintained by anyone.
  </strong>
</div>

### Check if the Figma Kits are active in your file

1. Open any Figma design file in the app or browser.

2. Select 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel and then the book icon.

2. Look under 'Libraries added to this file'. If there's a list of the 3 libraries (GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit, and MoJ Figma Kit) the Figma Kits are active. You do not need to do anything else.

3. If the 3 libraries do not appear, go to 'Browse libraries' in the modal sidebar. Then select 'Recommended' (it has a light bulb icon).

4. Hover over each library and select the 'Add to file' button.

3. Select 'This file' in the modal sidebar. You should now see the 3 libraries: GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit, and MoJ Figma Kit. The Figma Kits are active. You do not need to do anything else.

### Get updates from the Figma Kit

When the Figma Kit is updated, youâ€™ll be notified in Figma. To check for updates:

1. Go to a Figma design file
2. Select 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel and then the book icon.
2. Select 'Updates' from the sidebar. Underneath the text saying who published the change and when, you'll see a short summary of the changes made. This is where information about 'breaking' changes will be communicated.

3. Either select the 'Update all' button, or select 'Update' for each component you want to update.

## If you work outside MoJ Digital

### Download and use the Figma Kit

1. Open the [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040).
2. Select the Figma logo at the top of the left-hand sidebar and go to File > Save local copy.
<p><img src="/assets/images/figma-guidance-download-kit.png" style="border:none" alt="x"></p>

3. Add the downloaded file into your project, publish it as a library, and use it in your files.

### Manually update the Figma Kit

1. Every so often, check the live [MoJ Design System Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/N2xqOFkyehXwcD9DxU1gEq/MoJ-Figma-Kit?node-id=20-17040) file for updates.
2. If updates are showing in the kit, save a local copy of the latest version of the Figma Kit.
4. Reload it into your Figma workspace as a library.
5. Open your design files, and use the [swap libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries) feature in Figma to replace all references to the outdated version of the MoJ Figma Kit. You can only use 'swap libraries' with a paid Figma licence. If you do not have one, [swap components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413-Swap-components-and-instances) individually instead.
