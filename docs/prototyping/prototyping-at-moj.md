<span class="govuk-caption-xl">Prototyping is creating a model of a product or design. This is to test and improve it before making the final version.</span>

There are 3 main ways to prototype at MoJ:

- sketching (for example, sketching using a pen and paper)
- Figma  
- gov prototype kit 

Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and use cases.  

## Sketching (low fidelity prototyping)

Low fidelity prototyping involves sketching your designs. This is typically done with a pen and paper. It helps build a design foundation without spending much time or money.

### Advantages
- Quick and cheap  
- Create, iterate and throw away ideas without getting too bought-in to something
- focus on the flow and key concepts, not details 

### Disadvantages
- Cannot be used for testing
- Harder to share and collaborate remotely

## Government prototype kit (High fidelity prototyping)

The gov prototype kit (often called ‘the kit) is a coded package to create something which looks and acts like your service. 

This enables more realistic interactions and behaviour.

### Advantages 
- Better insights from user testing as real-life data and interactions can be made
- Stakeholders can get a better sense of how a product will behave
- Keyboard navigation possible with people who use assistive technologies like screen readers. 
- Responds to different devices and screen sizes. 
- Developers can directly access the code, resulting in a quicker transition from design to development. This can also help with judging how feasible a design is from a technical stand point, eliminating wasted time.

### Disadvantages
- Takes time
- Harder to collect comments and feedback from the whole team

## Figma (High fidelity prototyping)

Designers use Figma to create prototypes quickly and easily, without needing to code.  

It’s excellent for fast, high-fidelity designs and user flow visualisations. It has a much easier path to collaboration and democratisation as it allows everyone in the team to leave and read comments. 

It’s not an advanced prototyping tool. It’s limited for usability testing because it cannot handle high interactivity or specific user testing.

### Advantages 
- Figma is cloud-based, this allows multiple team members (interaction designers, user researchers, content designers, developers, stakeholders) to work simultaneously on the same file. 
can use the MoJ design system to ensure consistency.
- People can easily leave comments which are visible to others - easier than the kit
- Because users can comment directly on Figma prototypes, it becomes easy to create feedback loops without the need for complex review processes. 
- User flow & navigation: Figma is great for putting together user flows and simple, clickable prototypes to demonstrate how users will navigate the product. It is also great at understanding quickly whether information is placed correctly

### Disadvantages
- Limited in putting together advanced interactions
- Harder to show realistic data, content entries and playback
