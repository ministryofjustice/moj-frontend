If you work for the Ministry of Justice, we recommend using MOJ Cloud Platform to host your prototype.

The [Cloud Platform guide](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/prototype-kit.html) shows you how to set up a GitHub repository with the prototype kit installed, along with a Cloud Platform hosting environment. Changes to your repository will automatically be deployed to Cloud Platform.

If you have any further questions, use the [#ask-cloud-platform Slack channel (MOJ staff only)](https://mojdt.slack.com/messages/ask-cloud-platform).
