## Overview

Prototyping is the process of creating a model or design of something in order to test and iterate it before making a final version.

Prototypes can be high or low fidelity. Sketching is an example of low-fidelity prototyping. At MoJ, Figma and coded prototypes are the tools we use for high-fidelity prototyping.

There are advantages and disadvantages for each method. Choose one according to your needs.

## Sketching (low fidelity)

Sketching is typically done with a pen and paper and is sometimes called paper prototyping. You can also use a collaborative tool such as Miro.

### Advantages

- Quick and cheap.
- Builds a design foundation.
- Enables you to create, iterate and throw away ideas without getting invested.
- You can focus on the flow and key concepts, not details.

### Disadvantages

- Paper prototyping is harder to share – and collaborate on – remotely.
- Can be challenging to test with participants remotely.

### Use cases

Sketching is used to test designs early in the process.

## Figma (high fidelity)

Figma is a tool for creating designs, and user testing (depending on what the prototype needs to do).

### Advantages

- Fairly quick and easy.
- No coding knowledge needed.
- Enables the whole team to work together, including making and viewing comments.

### Disadvantages

- You need to be familiar with Figma.
- Interactions are quite limited.
- Harder to present realistic data.
- Cannot handle specific user testing, for example with assistive technology.
- Cannot respond to data input in testing.

### Use cases

- Building user flows.
- Making simple, clickable prototypes to show navigation.
- Connecting to the MoJ Design System through the Figma Kits.

## GOV.UK Prototype Kit (high fidelity)

The GOV.UK Prototype Kit (sometimes called ‘the kit’) enables you to create something that looks and acts like your service.

### Advantages

- The team and stakeholders get a better sense of how a product will behave.
- Responds to different devices and screen sizes.
- Easier handover from design to development (and for working out if a design is feasible).

### Disadvantages

- Takes more time to build.
- You need coding skills.
- Harder to collect comments and feedback from the whole team.

### Use cases

- User testing with real data and interactions, plus keyboard navigation.
- Testing with assistive technologies users.
