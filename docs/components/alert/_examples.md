## Examples

### Alerts in a case management system

An error and success alert under an H1 shows a user that one of their tasks failed, and another was successful. It can be shown on the dashboard rather than another page.

<p><img src="{{ 'assets/images/alert-example-case-management.png' | rev | url }}" alt="An MOJ webpage showing a success alert positioned below the heading level 1."></p>

### Error alert under a subheading

Alerts positioned inline with other content help people to understand what the message relates to. In this example the heading level of the alert component should be changed to H3 as it appears within an H2 heading.

<p><img src="{{ 'assets/images/alert-example-contextual.png' | rev | url }}" alt="A warning alert with heading level 3 is shown beneath a heading level 2 on an MOJ webpage to highlight the importance of maintaining heading structure.'"></p>
