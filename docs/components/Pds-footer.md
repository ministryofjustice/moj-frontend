## Overview
The PDS footer is part of a [library of components](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDS1/pages/5735448595/Components) designed to create a consistent user experience across probation services.

Itâ€™s based on the GOV.UK footer component, with changes to meet the needs of internal-facing probation services.
