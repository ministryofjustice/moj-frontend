## When to use

Use this component when users need to add similar information a couple of times, such as several names for a single application.


## When not to use

Do not use this pattern when users need to add different kinds of information that do not relate to each other.

If users need to add information many times, it may cause performance and validation issues as the page will get very long. In this case, you should use [add to a list](../../patterns/add-to-a-list).

## How to use

The add another component relies on JavaScript. When JavaScript is not available, your page should reload with the additional form elements if the "Add another" button is pressed.

## Research

This component has been tested in prototypes of several citizen and internal products, including:

- Claim fees for Crown court defence (Legal Aid Agency)
- Moving People Safely (Her Majestyâ€™s Prison and Probation Service)
