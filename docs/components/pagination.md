title: Pagination
---

Use the pagination component to let users browse through a long list.

{% lastUpdated "pagination" %}

{% example "/examples/pagination", 125 %}

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the pagination component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

The component can be configured to hide or show the result count, previous and next buttons, ellipses or numbers.

Don't show pagination if there's only one page.

### Just previous and next buttons

{% example "/examples/pagination-prev-next", 125 %}
