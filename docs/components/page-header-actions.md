title: Page header actions
---

Use the page header actions component for certain actions.

{% lastUpdated "page-header-actions" %}

{% example "/examples/page-header-actions", 150 %}

## When to use this component

Use this when:

- the content of the page is so long that users have to scroll past it to see actions. For example, having a “Create case” button underneath a long list of cases.
- the action is applied to the page item and not one specific part of the content. For example, in a user profile page, it could make sense to put the “Suspend user” action in the header.

## When not to use this component

Don’t place buttons next to the header when they are specific to a component within the page.

## How it works

The component ensures the buttons are aligned right in line with the heading. On small screens the buttons tuck underneath the heading.

## Research on this component

We need more research. If you have used the page header actions component, get in touch to share your research findings.
