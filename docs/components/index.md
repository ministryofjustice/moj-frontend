Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](../patterns) and contexts.

If you are using [Ministry of Justice Frontend](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend) in your prototype kit or in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.

<!-- See all the [components in the backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog/issues). -->
