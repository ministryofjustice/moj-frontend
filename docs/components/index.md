<span class="govuk-caption-xl">Save time with reusable, accessible components for forms, navigation, panels, tables and more.</span>

Components are reusable parts of a user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications. Individual components can be used in multiple different pages, patterns and context.

To use a component you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs))

<!-- include this bullet point when Figma UI Kit is completed

- use the MoJ Figma UI Kit
