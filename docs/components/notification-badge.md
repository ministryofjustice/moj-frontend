## When to use

The notification badge lets the user know that there is new information to view, like unread messages, and how many of them there are.

Only use it if the number changes when the user performs an action.
## When not to use

Do not use the notification badge when:

- the number of things is 0
- there is no action

Unless there is a strong user need, only use it as a part of the navigation.

## How to use

Display the notification badge to the right-hand side of the information it refers to.

If the number is more than 99, display ‘99+’.
## Research

Research shows that notification badges are common across online services, smartphones and apps. Usability testing showed:

- users understand what it is for
- it does not distract users from their task
