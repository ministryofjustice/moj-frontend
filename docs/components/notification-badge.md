title: Notification badge
---

Use the notification badge component to notify users of something like an unread message.

{% example "/examples/notification-badge", 125 %}

## When to use this component

Use this component when the user needs to be alerted that they have, for example, unread messages and how many of them there are. Only use it if the number changes when the user performs an action.

## When not to use this component

Do not use this component when the number of things is zero, or there is no action to take.

Unless there is a strong user need, only use this component as a part of the navigation.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the notification badge component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.
