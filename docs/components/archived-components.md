- [Form validator](#form-validator)
- [Rich text editor](#rich-text-editor)
- [Tag](#tag)

## Currency input

[Currency input](../currency-input) was archived on 23 June 2021.

You should use [prefixes and suffixes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/#prefixes-and-suffixes) in the GOV.UK Design System to help users enter things like currencies.

## Form validator

[Form validator](../form-validator) was archived on 20 April 2022.

This component was deemed not sufficiently accessible to be used in live services and too complex to maintain.

You must validate forms on the server-side. If you require client-side validation, start with [native browser form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation).
For more complex validation, use an accessible validation library.

## Rich text editor

[Rich text editor](../rich-text-editor) was archived on 20 April 2022.

This component was deemed not sufficiently accessible to be used in live services and too complex to maintain.

You should use an accessible rich text editor.

## Tag

Additional colours of [Tag](../tag) was archived on 23 June 2021.

The GOV.UK Design System working group [made a decision to use tints for additional colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/62#issuecomment-590800378).

You should use [additional colours](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/#additional-colours) in the GOV.UK Design System.
