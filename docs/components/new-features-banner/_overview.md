## Overview
Banner that appears below the header and above any navigation that allows users to click into a subsequent page that informs them of changes, fixes and updates to the product they're using.

### How the component is currently used

It is currently being used in 'Allocate a Person on Probation' (APoP) and it is going to be implemented in 'Manage a Person on Probation' (MPoP) soon too, to announce changes to our users in a consistent way.
