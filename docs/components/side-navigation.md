## When not to use this component

Do not use this component for primary level items or global navigation items.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the side navigation component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

The component can be configured to group navigation items into sections
