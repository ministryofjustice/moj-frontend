### How the component is currently used

Writing content:
The number part of the component can be written as an integer, a decimal, an amount of currency or a percentage.

It should not be presented as a word or a fraction.

The label should be short and succinct. Recommend no more than 20 characters.

Making sure it’s accessible:
- Recommended use is black text, on white, or gov-uk light-grey, background.
- Labels and text should make sense when you read it visually or with screenreader
- If using multiple instances:
  - use a heading to provide context
