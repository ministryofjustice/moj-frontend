## When to use

Use the sub navigation component to let users navigate sub sections in a system or service.

Use this component when you have a second level of navigation. There's also the [side navigation component](/components/side-navigation/).

You can use the [notification badge component](/components/notification-badge/) to show that there are new or unread items in the sub sections.

## When not to use

Do not use this component for primary level items or global navigation items.
