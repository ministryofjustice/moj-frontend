## Overview
Use the numeric data pattern to make pieces of information easier to scan, interpret and action where required.

### How the component is currently used

The number can be written as an integer, a decimal, currency or a percentage.

It should not be presented as a word or a fraction.

The label should be short and succinct, ideally no more than 20 characters.

To make it accessible:
- use black text on a white or gov-uk light-grey background
- ensure that labels and text make sense when you read it visually or with a screenreader

If using multiple instances:
  - use a heading to provide context
  - check for responsiveness on multiple screen sizes

If using a link, check that it makes sense to a screen reader.
