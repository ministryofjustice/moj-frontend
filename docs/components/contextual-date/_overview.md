## Overview
Use the contextual date pattern to indicate important information about a date in a table to make it easier to scan, interpret and action where required.

### How the component is currently used

The date can be written as DD/MM/YY or DD Month YYYY, depending on the use case of the system.

The label should be short and succinct, ideally no more than 20 characters.

Never use this component without a label - the label provides the context to the visual highlight for accessibility.

To make it accessible use:

- standard black text
- bold 19px for the date
- regular 16px for the context

Make sure the highlight line has:

- accessible colour contrast  
- distinguishable colours (if you're using more than one highlight line)

Never use this component without a label - the label provides the context to the visual highlight for accessibility.
