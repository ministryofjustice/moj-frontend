## Overview
The component is used to present content in a modal dialog.  It is used to interrupt a user with information that must be interacted with before continuing.  When the dialog is open, the rest of the page is rendered inert and focus is trapped within the dialog.

### How the component is currently used

The component was based on prototypes within the GOV.UK Design System discussion backlogs, and was developed for and used within the MOJ Forms platform for live forms.

### Contribute to this component
