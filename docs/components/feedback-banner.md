## Overview
When we release new non-transactional features on DPS, we need a way of capturing user feedback.

This mechanism could be used in the short-medium term and allow teams to learn from the release so that we can iterate specific new features/ pages during beta.

### How the component is currently used

We created a new component below the prison switcher in the header area. This is more in line with the existing GOV.UK phase banner.

This new design worked better for a page we were building that used a side navigation. Because the feedback component sits above the page body it could accommodate split column page layouts better.
