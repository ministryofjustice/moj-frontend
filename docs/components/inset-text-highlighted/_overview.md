## Overview
A blue variable version of the inset text component

### How the component is currently used

To highlight guidance to internal users as part of a service. We hypothesised that the warning component felt too urgent and the inset text could be easily missed or ignored in this context. Users are time-poor and expected to read through a fair bit of guidance. This component was being used by the DVLA to highlight content to users. This guidance inset has tested well and especially with users with access needs, they remarked that it helped them break down the content visually to process the content easier.
