## Examples

### Within a case management system

The location of the buttons helps users to know what the tasks relate to.

<p><img src="{{ 'assets/images/button-menu-case-management-example-2024.png' | rev | url }}" alt="An example of a button menu used next to a GOV.UK default button on a Ministry of Justice webpage. The grey button menu is to the right of the green GOV.UK button. Both are to the right of an H2 called 'Case management'. This is all below an H1 called 'Tom Smith'. The green button reads 'Record review' and the button menu has 'Print options' as a title, and contains the items: Print case, Print review, Print investigation and Print referral."></p>

### Within the multi select component

Adding a button menu to the multi select component helps users complete common tasks quickly, for example assigning cases.

The grey button menu is to the right of the green button. This is next to the H2 title 'Case management'. Both are below the H1 title 'Case management'.
