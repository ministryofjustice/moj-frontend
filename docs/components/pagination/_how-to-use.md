## How to use

You can read [guidance on using the GOV.UK pagination component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/), which is a part of this component.

### Position on the page

ENTER CONTENT.

### Full pages of results - MOVE THIS, BUT WHERE?

If the results are the entire content of the page, add the amount of results to the title and h1. This improves accessibility. 

### Choosing a results count variant

INSERT IMAGE OF THE SEARCH RESULTS

When choosing a results count for the pagination component consider:
- information that's already on the page, for example the number of results in a heading
- what's relevant to the user and their task, for example a  results range  11-20 mean anything to them

### Setting results per page

 Results per page are controlled by a table or list component, rather than by pagination. When choosing the amount per page consider:

- if research shows that users want to browse or compare results(rather than look for a particular one)
- the time users will have to spend navigating between pages
- the depth of results (for example if they take more than 1 row)  
- the cognitive load of the page

{% example template="examples/prev-next", colocated=true, height=125 %}

## EXAMPLES

USE THEM TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTS CONTENT.
