## Overview
Use the contextual date pattern to indicate important information about a date in a table to make it easier to scan, interpret and action where required.

### How the component is currently used

Writing content:
The date can be written as DD/MM/YY or DD Month YYYY, depending on the use case of the system

The label should be short and succinct. Recommend no more than 20 characters.

Never use this component without a label - the label provides the context to the visual highlight for accessibility.

Making sure it’s accessible:
- Recommended typography is standard black text
  - Bold 19px for the date
  - Regular 16px for the context
- The highlight line should have appropriate colour contrast
- When using for to communicate more than one context the highlight line should use colours that are not too close to each other for most differentiation
- Never use this component without a label - the label provides the context to the visual highlight for accessibility.
