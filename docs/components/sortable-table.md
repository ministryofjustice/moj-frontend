{% example "/examples/sortable-table", 450 %}

## When to use this component

Use this component when sorting is needed to help find data within a large table of data. This might be useful in combination with the [filter](../../patterns/filter-a-list) pattern.

You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/), you can use the Nunjucks [table macro](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/).
