## Overview

When users first open the date picker's calendar it'll show today's date. Users do not have to use this calendar view to select a date â€” they can also enter one directly into the text field.

### When to use

Users might want to use the calendar view:

- for a relative date or one they need to look up, for example last Thursday or next Wednesday
- to enter today's date more quickly
- for available dates only, such as for prison visits

### When not to use

Do not use the date picker:

- for a memorable date, such as a user's date of birth
- for a date that users know or can easily look up, like an appointment date on a letter
- when only a rough date is needed, for example just a month and year

Use the [GOV.UK Design System's date input component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/) instead.

### Things to consider

Date pickers are fully navigable using a keyboard, but can be slow for keyboard-only and screen reader users.

### Similar or linked components

There's also the ['Ask users for dates' pattern in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/).
