title: Meet the ethics standards
---

Our ethics standards are in beta. It is not a requirement to follow our ethics standards for service assessments but they are worth considering.

## 1. Consider how your service impacts people individually and socially

For example, your service should minimise:

- psychological harms like trauma and anxiety
- the risk to people’s safety, security or privacy
- the opportunity for people to be abused

Your service should not:

- make people vulnerable
- isolate people
- exclude people
- polarise people

### Why it’s important

The Ministry of Justice is responsible for supporting its users’ welfare. People interacting with the justice system often do so because something has gone wrong. In some situations, they might also be vulnerable.

### How to meet point 1

To meet point 1, you should: 

- learn the [MoJ ethics principles](/ethics/principles)
- do an [MoJ ethics assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRHSKxj3_zXubfDkGHQp9Y2_6wpf9_dcB9qCuHQS4xM/)
- use the [Data ethics framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework-2020) if your service stores personal information
- use the [Ethics, Transparency and Accountability Framework for Automated Decision-Making](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ethics-transparency-and-accountability-framework-for-automated-decision-making/ethics-transparency-and-accountability-framework-for-automated-decision-making) if your service uses AI

## 2. Consider the impact of your service on the environment

For example, your service should use sustainable, environmentally friendly technologies where possible and minimise:

- emissions
- energy consumption
- dependency on paper processes
- waste
- the amount users need to travel

### Why it’s important

The UK is committed to its sustainability objectives outlined in [Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-sustainable-development-goals/implementing-the-sustainable-development-goals--2). Our services should align with those objectives.

### How to meet point 2

Show that your team has considered the impact of your service on the environment by:

- setting sustainable goals
- reviewing and reporting on your sustainable goals
- using a carbon calculator (AWS and Microsoft both offer this service)
- scheduling an independent sustainability audit
- using eco friendly suppliers 

You can also make a plan to:

- reduce paper in your service
- automate simple tasks
- decommission legacy systems
- reduce the amount users need to travel
