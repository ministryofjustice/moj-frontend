## How to consider ethics

All teams designing and building MoJ digital services should be mindful of how their design may impact people and society.

This guidance will help your team:

- develop services responsibly, so you can reduce, mitigate or remove harm from users
- [prepare for your service assessment](/ethics/assessment/)
- reflect on the ethics of your service using our [ethics review](/ethics/review/) or [ethical principles](/ethics/principles/)


## Why you should consider ethics

There are many reasons to consider ethics. Some positive impacts include:

- making sure vulnerable people are not exploited or put in danger
- lowering the chances of your service harming people
- reducing the risk of re-traumatisation and making people feel psychologically safe (by using a trauma-aware or trauma-informed approach)
- making sure no groups are discriminated against (by understanding bias within your team)
- making sure people trust your service and that they do not lose confidence in MoJ (for example, by explaining where you’ve used AI and automated decision-making)
