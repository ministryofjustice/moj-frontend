Our ethical design principles are a set of ideals to guide how MoJ services are designed and built over time. 

Although it may not be possible to apply all of our principles, use them as inspiration to improve how you work.

## 1. Minimise harm
Maximise well-being and minimise harm (this includes physical and mental well-being and harm).

## 2. Prioritise people
Treat people as people, not as numbers or targets for the organisation.

## 3. Include everyone
Provide equal opportunities and resources for all individuals and groups.

## 4. Balance power
Balance power between individual people and between people and your organisation.

## 5. Be honest
Do not mislead or deceive people.

## 6. Respect people’s property
Keep people’s property safe and handle it with care. Personal data is personal property.

## 7. Protect the environment
Make sustainable products and services without depleting resources or harming the environment.

## 8. Take responsibility
Know who is responsible for making your product or service ethical (it’s likely to be everyone). Make sure everyone agrees on what they need to do. Be clear about what your responsibility is and own your part.
