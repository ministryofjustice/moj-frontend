title: Designing ethical services
---

Anyone designing and building MoJ services must be mindful of the impact of their design on people, society and the planet.

## Why you should consider ethics

Your team should consider ethics if:

- vulnerable people interact with your service
- someone could be harmed as a consequence of your service
- people use your service because they have experienced a trauma in their life
- your service uses AI

To make sure that:

- vulnerable people are not exploited or made even more vulnerable
- you lower the chances that people get harmed
- you can consider a trauma aware or trauma informed approach to reduce re-traumatisation
- your service does not harm people, confuse people or make people lose trust due to automated decision making as a consequence of AI

## When to consider ethics

Make sure that your team is designing and developing responsibly throughout the lifecycle of your service.

You should demonstrate that you have considered the ethics of your service in each stage of its lifecycle (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, and Live).

## Make sure your service is ethical

1. [Follow our ethics standards](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/ethics/standards/) and make ethics a practical part of your design process.
2. [Do an ethics assessment](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/ethics/assessment/) and understand the impact that your service has on people and the planet.
3. Learn and share the [MoJ ethical design principles](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/ethics/principles/).
