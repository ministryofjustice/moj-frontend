Anyone designing and building MoJ services must be mindful of the impact of their design on people, society and the planet.

1. Learn and share the [MoJ ethical design principles](/ethics/principles).
2. [Follow our ethics standards](/ethics/standards) and make ethics a practical part of your design process.
3. [Do an ethics assessment](/ethics/assessment)Â and understand the impact that your service has on people and the planet.
