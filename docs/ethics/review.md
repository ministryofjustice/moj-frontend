An ethics review will help you:

- design, develop and maintain responsible services
- identify any unintended consequences of your service

## How to do an ethics review

Make a copy of the [ethics review template in Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlD7OmE=/?userEmail=laura.parker6@digital.justice.gov.uk&track=true&utm_source=notification&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=add-to-board&utm_content=go-to-board). There are instructions on the board about how to use it.

You can do the review remotely or in person. There's no time-limit, but for reference, it took one team about 2 hours to do their review in person.

The outputs you get are likely to vary significantly depending on what your service does, who uses it, which phase of delivery youâ€™re at and how information is stored and used.
