title: Do an ethics assessment
---

We must ensure that our services are inclusive, environmentally friendly, respectful of people's property, and do not harm people.

Doing an ethics assessment will help you to:

- design, develop and maintain responsible services
- identify any unintended consequences of your service

Your team can do ethics assessments at any stage of the life cycle.

### What you need to do an ethics assessment

Make a copy of the ethics assessment template on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GRHSKxj3_zXubfDkGHQp9Y2_6wpf9_dcB9qCuHQS4xM/edit) or [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlD7OmE=/?userEmail=laura.parker6@digital.justice.gov.uk&track=true&utm_source=notification&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=add-to-board&utm_content=go-to-board) (both come with instructions).

You can do the assessment remotely or in person.

There's no time limit, but for reference, it took one team about 2 hours to do the ethics assessment in person using sticky notes.  

The outputs you get are likely to vary significantly depending on what your service does, who uses it, which phase of delivery you are at and how information is stored and used.
