You can use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is through submitting building blocks that your team has built, as well as joining discussions to help other blocks develop.

## Adding a component

You can now add a component to the MoJ Design System. You might want to do this to:  

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people to help the component develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can add a component. You do not have to be a designer or developer.

### Which components can be added

If a component has a name and image, and you can briefly describe it, it's ready to be added. If you have code and a Figma file that's great too, although you do not need it.

The component does not need to be thoroughly tested, documented or considered for wider use. For someone working on a problem from scratch, a community component can still be a helpful starting point or idea.

The component will get an 'experimental' status. This is to reflect that it's early in development and only to be used in alpha and beta phases. You can [read about the MoJ Design System statuses](/design-system-statuses/).

</a>

## Adding a pattern or page

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page.
</div>

These building blocks will also have an experimental status.

## Joining discussions

After an experimental building block is live, it can continue to develop through discussions and contributions. This is through a Github discussion thread, which is in the documentation for every community component.

The comments might include feedback, images, user research findings and accessibility insights.
