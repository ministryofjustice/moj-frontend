You can now use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is by adding a component.

When a component has been added to the Design System it'll be a 'community component'. You might want to create this type of component to:  

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people to help the component develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

^ Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page to the MoJ Design System.

## How to add a component

Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can add a component. You do not have to be a designer or developer.

You can add a component with just a name, description and image. It does not need to be thoroughly tested or documented. Community components have an 'experimental' status to reflect that they are early in development. [Read about the MoJ Design System statuses](/design-system-statuses/)   

## What happens after you submit a component

s1. The MoJ Design System team will briefly check it.

s2. You'll get an email once it's live - usually within 5 working days.  

s3. There'll be a Github discussion for each component, where people will be able to add information to further develop it. [View all MoJ Design System Github discussions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/discussions)
