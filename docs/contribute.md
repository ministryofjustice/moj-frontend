You can use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is through submitting building blocks that your team has built, as well as joining discussions to help other blocks develop.

## Adding a building block

You can now add a building block to the MoJ Design System. You might want to do this to:

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people to help the building block develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can add a building block. You do not have to be a designer or developer.

### Which building blocks can be added

Components can be added to the MoJ Design System. Later in 2025, you'll also be able to add a pattern or page.

If the component has a name and image, and you can briefly describe it, it's ready to be added. If you have code and a Figma file that's great too, although you do not need it.

It does not need to be thoroughly tested, documented or considered for wider use. For someone working on a problem from scratch, it can be a helpful starting point or idea.

The component will be given an 'experimental' status. This is to reflect that it's early in development and only to be used in alpha and beta phases. You can [read about the MoJ Design System statuses](/design-system-statuses/).

## Joining discussions

After an experimental building block is live, it can continue to develop through discussions and contributions. This is through a Github discussion thread, which is in the documentation for every experimental building block.

The comments might include feedback, images, user research findings and accessibility insights.
