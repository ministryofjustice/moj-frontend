You can use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is through submitting building blocks that your team has built, as well as joining discussions to help other blocks develop.

## Adding a component

You can now add a component to the the MoJ Design System.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page.
</div>

When a component is added to the Design System it becomes a 'community component'. You might want to create this type of component to:  

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people to help the component develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can add a component. You do not have to be a designer or developer.

All you need is a component name, description and image. If you have code and a Figma file that's great too, although you do not need it.

The component does not need to be thoroughly tested, documented or considered for wider use. For someone working on a problem from scratch, a community component can still be helpful be a starting point or idea.

[Submit a component to the MoJ Design System](/contribute/add-new-component/start/)

## Joining discussions

After a community building block is live, it can continue to develop through discussions and contributions. This is through a Github discussion thread, which is in the documentation for every community component.

The comments might include feedback, images, user research findings and accessibility insights.

## Community building block statuses

Every building block on the MoJ Design System is given a status. This is to help people know how it should be used.

Community building blocks have the 'experimental' status. This is to reflect that they are early in development and only to be used in alpha and beta phases. You can [read about the MoJ Design System statuses](/design-system-statuses/).
