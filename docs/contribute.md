You can now use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is by adding a component.

^ Later in 2025 you'll also be able to add a pattern or page.

Adding a component to the Design System means:  

- it'll be easier to find for teams across government
- it can continue to develop, through contributions and help from other people
- can be shared after a service assessment

You can view an example of a 'community component on the MoJ Design System.
Working in the open helps your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).

## How to submit a component

Anyone at MoJ or in UK government can do this. You do not have to be a designer or developer.



To submit a component, you'll need basic information such as a name, a brief description and an image. You do not need a Figma file or code, although adding these is helpful.

## What happens after you submit a component

s1. The MoJ Design System team will give the component a brief sense check and then it'll be live within 5 working days. It might take a longer if the team need to contact you. You'll get an email once it's live.

s2. It'll become a 'community component' and will have an 'experimental' status. This helps people to know how to use it.  

s3. Once





This means its in the early steps of development as a building block. And may not have yet been considered for use in a full service. Experimental building blocks are only to be used in alpha and beta phases of a project.

## Continue developing existing building blocks via GitHub

After a new building block is published in the design system, you, and other users, have the chance to continue developing it. This is done with users continuing to add more information and resources to the building block via GitHub.

### Adding information to a building block in GitHub

You should:

- find the building block you want to add more information to from the list in the left-hand navigation menu
- select the information you want to add using the tabbed menu
- select the link to go to the GitHub conversation
- add your comments, information and resources about the building block

### Using building blocks still in development

The more developed a building block is, the better the chance other users will consider using it in their own service if it can help them solve a problem. However, until they receive an "Official" status, they're only to be used in alpha and beta project phases.
