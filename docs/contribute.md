You can use the MoJ Design System to share your work with others. This is through submitting building blocks that your team has built, as well as joining discussions to help other blocks develop.

## Adding a building block

If you work at MoJ, you can now add a building block to the MoJ Design System. You might want to do this to:

- make it easier for teams across government to find your work
- get contributions from other people (including outside MoJ) to help the building block develop
- help your team meet the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)

Anyone at MoJ can add a building block - you do not have to be a designer or developer.

### Which building blocks can be added

Components can be added to the MoJ Design System. Later in 2025, you'll also be able to add a pattern or page.

If the component has a name, image, and you can briefly describe it, it's ready to be added. If you have code and a Figma file that's great too, although you do not need it.

It does not need to be thoroughly tested, documented or considered for wider use. For someone working on a problem from scratch, it can be a helpful starting point or idea.

The component will be given an 'experimental' status. This is to show that it's early in development and only to be used in alpha and beta phases. You can [read about the MoJ Design System statuses](/design-system-statuses/).

## Joining discussions

After an experimental building block is live, contributions can be added to a Github discussion thread. These might include feedback, images, user research findings or accessibility insights.

If you've used an experimental building block in your service, please add any findings to the thread. This helps it develop.  

You can find the Github discussion thread link in every experimental building block.
