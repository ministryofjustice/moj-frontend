3 Figma Kits are activated by default in all new Figma files for MoJ Figma users.

## Check if the Figma Kits are active in your file

1. Open any Figma design file in the app or a browser.

2. Select 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel and then the book icon.

The 'Assets' tab is selected."></p>

3. Look under 'Libraries added to this file'. If there's a list of the 3 libraries (GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit, and MoJ Figma Kit) the Figma Kits are active. You do not need to do anything else.

The content in the main pane is in two sections: 'Assets created in this file' and 'Libraries added to this file'. Under 'Libraries added to this file' there are three libraries: 'GOV & MoJ Styles', 'GOV Figma Kit' and 'MoJ Figma Kit'. Next to each, there is a 'Remove' button."></p>

4. If the 3 libraries do not appear, go to 'Browse libraries' in the modal sidebar. Then select 'Recommended' (it has a light bulb icon).

5. Hover over each library and select the 'Add to file' button.

The content in the main pane shows the heading 'Recommended libraries' and the text 'Your admins suggest using these libraries'. Underneath there is another heading reading 'Recommended by Ministry of Justice', with three libraries shown below: 'GOV & MoJ Styles', 'GOV Figma Kit' and 'MoJ Figma Kit'. 'GOV & MoJ Styles' is being hovered over and has an 'Add to file' button over it."></p>

6. Select 'This file' in the modal sidebar. You should now see the 3 libraries: GOV & MoJ Styles, GOV Figma Kit, and MoJ Figma Kit. The Figma Kits are active. You do not need to do anything else.


## Get updates from the Figma Kits

When the Figma Kits are updated, youâ€™ll be notified in Figma. To check for updates:

1. Go to a Figma design file
2. Select 'Assets' from the left-hand side panel and then the book icon.
3. Select 'Updates' from the sidebar. Underneath the text saying who published a change and when, you'll see a short summary of the changes made. This is where information about 'breaking' changes will be communicated.
<p><img src="/assets/images/figma-guidance-update.png" style="border:none" alt="A 'Manage libraries' modal window with a sidebar showing a 'Updates' tab selected. The content in the main pane shows the heading 'Updates from Test library', a line of text 'Published by Murray Lippiatt 4 minutes ago', and another line of text 'Updated 'Date picker' component: added hover states to calendar numbers.' Underneath this is an image of the date picker component with 'Date picker' and a button labelled 'Update' next to it. At the bottom of the window are a toggle switch labelled 'Show updates for all pages', and a button labelled 'Update all'."></p>

4. Either select the 'Update all' button, or select 'Update' for each component you want to update.
