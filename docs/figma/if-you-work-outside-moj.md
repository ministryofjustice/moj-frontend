If you work outside of the Ministry of Justice, you'll need to download and add the Figma Kits you want to use to your project. See [where to find the Figma Kits](/figma/about-the-figma-kits#where-to-find-the-figma-kits)

## Download and use the Figma Kits

1. Open the Figma Kit you want to download and use.
2. Select the Figma logo at the top of the left-hand sidebar and go to File > Save local copy.

3. Add the downloaded file into your project, publish it as a library, and use it in your files.


## Manually update the Figma Kits

1. Every so often, check the live Figma Kit files for updates.
2. Save a local copy of the latest version of the Figma Kit.
3. Reload it into your Figma workspace as a library.
4. Open your design files, and use the [swap libraries](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries) feature in Figma to replace all references to the outdated version of the Figma Kit. You can only use 'swap libraries' with a paid Figma licence. If you do not have one, [swap component instances](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413-Swap-components-and-instances) individually instead.
5. Repeat steps 1--4 for each Figma Kit you want to update.
