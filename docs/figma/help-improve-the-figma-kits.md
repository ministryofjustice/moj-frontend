The MoJ Design System team would like to hear:

- if a GOV.UK or MoJ component is missing from the Figma Kits
- if a Figma component isn't working properly
- if you find a mistake on a Figma component (for example, the wrong font weight or spacing)

You can [contact the MoJ Design System team](/help) to give us your feedback.
