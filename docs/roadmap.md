This roadmap sets out what the MoJ Design System team will be working on and has recently delivered. 

The roadmap supports consistency, accessibility and reuse across MOJ services by showing where the team is focusing its efforts and how this aligns with shared standards and user needs. 

The roadmap may change as we learn more, respond to feedback or adjust priorities. It's not a commitment to a fixed plan, but is here to give transparency, support informed decisionmaking, and encourage collaboration and reuse.

Understand what improvements, building blocks and guidance are coming, so that your team can plan work with confidence.
