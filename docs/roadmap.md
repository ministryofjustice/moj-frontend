<b>Last updated: 24 February 2026</b>

This roadmap shows what we're working on and planning to do next.

It's not fixed -- our plans might change as we learn more, respond to feedback, or adjust priorities.  

The roadmap is for transparency, to help informed decision making, and encourage collaboration and reuse.

Understand what improvements are coming so that your team can plan its work with confidence.

### New official components

These components are new or were developed from the 'to be reviewed' status:

- [Probation Digital Services (PDS) footer](/probation/components/pds-footer/)
- [PDS header](/probation/components/pds-header/)
- [pagination](/components/pagination/)

## What we're working on now
 
We're developing the following building blocks to the 'official' status so that they can be used in live services:

- [add another component](/components/add-another/) 
- [search component](/components/search/) 
- [electronic signature pattern](/patterns/electronic-signature/)

We're also improving navigation components and guidance.

## Coming up next

We'll be exploring:
- PDS breadcrumbs and back links to help users navigate services more easily 
- a more consistent way for users of PDS services to get support and escalate problems
- how PDS identifies users on probation

We'll develop the following components to the 'official' status:
- [filter component](/components/filter/)   
- [side navigation component](components/side-navigation/)  
- [ticket panel component](/components/ticket-panel/)

## The future 

We plan to:
- add 2 new workstreams to the MOJ Design System team - Prisons Digital and the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
- use AI more to improve the Design System
