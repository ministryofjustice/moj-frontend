  "componentName": "RoSH widget",
  "componentOverview": "The Risk of Serious Harm (RoSH) widget presents a clear, at-a-glance summary of an individual’s assessed risk. It draws data from the OASys risk assessment system and displays the overall RoSH level (low, medium, high, or very high), the date of the most recent update, and specific risks to different groups in both community and custody contexts.\r\n\r\nThe information is shown in a simple table format, using both words and colour coding to communicate risk levels consistently. Categories of potential victims include children, the public, known adults, staff, and prisoners. Where a category does not apply, “N/A” is displayed. Variations exist to show risks for community, custody, both contexts, or when risk information is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe widget includes states for “UNKNOWN LEVEL RoSH” where a summary has not been completed or where information cannot be obtained. Distinct outlines and explanatory text are used to prevent confusion, ensuring users understand whether risk information is missing or unavailable. Accessibility updates have been implemented, including colour contrast compliance and responsive design fixes for magnification. A Figma library of risk components is available for design use.",
  "howIsTheComponentUsed": "The RoSH widget is used across multiple HMPPS digital services to support probation and prison staff, as well as third-party service providers. It enables users to quickly understand an individual’s risk level without needing to navigate away from their task, helping them form a picture of risks and needs efficiently.\r\n\r\nIt is currently live or in public beta in services including Community Payback Assessment, Refer and Monitor an Intervention (Accommodation referral), Manage a Workforce, Deciding if Someone Should be Recalled, Approved Premises, and Manage POM Cases.\r\n\r\nThe widget helps probation staff, prison staff, and third-party providers by:\r\n\r\nquickly showing the overall RoSH score\r\n\r\nbreaking down risks by group and context (community or custody)\r\n\r\nproviding a consistent way of displaying risk across services\r\n\r\nsupporting external providers in assessing new referrals\r\n\r\nUser research highlighted that “NO RoSH” was being interpreted as “LOW RoSH.” This was updated to “UNKNOWN LEVEL RoSH” with clearer messaging, prompting users to confirm details in OASys when needed. This change improves accuracy and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nThe widget is particularly useful in sidebars, task lists, or documents such as Community Payback Assessment PDFs, where quick reference to risk levels is essential."
