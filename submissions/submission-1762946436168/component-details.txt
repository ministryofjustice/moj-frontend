  "componentName": "Feedback banner",
  "componentOverview": "When we release new non-transactional features on DPS, we need a way of capturing user feedback.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism could be used in the short-medium term and allow teams to learn from the release so that we can iterate specific new features/ pages during beta.",
  "howIsTheComponentUsed": "We created a new component below the prison switcher in the header area. This is more in line with the existing GOV.UK phase banner.\r\n\r\nThis new design worked better for a page we were building that used a side navigation. Because the feedback component sits above the page body it could accommodate split column page layouts better."
