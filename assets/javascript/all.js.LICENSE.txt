/**
 * Accordion component
 *
 * This allows a collection of sections to be collapsed by default, showing only
 * their headers. Sections can be expanded or collapsed individually by clicking
 * their headers. A "Show all sections" button is also added to the top of the
 * accordion, which switches to "Hide all sections" when all the sections are
 * expanded.
 *
 * The state of each section is saved to the DOM via the `aria-expanded`
 * attribute, which also provides accessibility.

/**
 * Character count component

 * Tracks the number of characters or words in the `.govuk-js-character-count`

 * of characters/words available, or the number of characters/words in excess.
 *
 * You can configure the message to only appear after a certain percentage
 * of the available characters/words has been entered.
