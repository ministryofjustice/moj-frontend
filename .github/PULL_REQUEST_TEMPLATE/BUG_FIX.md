- Fill out the template below. Maintainers are free to close any pull requests that do not include enough information, at their discretion.
- The pull request must only fix an existing bug. To contribute other changes, you must use a different template. You can see all templates at https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/tree/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.
- The pull request must update the test suite to demonstrate the changed functionality.
- After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your contribution. For more details, please see https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests.

### Identify the bug

<!--

Link to the issue describing the bug that you're fixing.

If there is not yet an issue for your bug, please open a new issue and then link to that issue in your pull request.
Note: In some cases, one person's "bug" is another person's "feature." If the pull request does not address an existing issue with the "bug" label, the maintainers have the final say on whether the current behaviour is a bug.
